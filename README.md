# Tukangin

## Project Overview

"Tukangin" (derived from "Tukang," meaning craftsman or skilled worker in Indonesian) is envisioned as a platform designed to connect individuals or businesses in need of various services with skilled craftsmen and service providers. This repository likely contains the client-side application or a component of the "Tukangin" ecosystem, complementing a potential backend server (like `tukangin-server`) and a database.

The primary goal of this project is to streamline the process of finding and hiring professional "tukang" for a wide range of tasks, from home repairs and construction to specialized technical services.
